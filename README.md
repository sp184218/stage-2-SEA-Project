# 🎬 Sydni's Big 3 M's - A Catalog Experience

Welcome to **Sydni's Big 3 M's**, an interactive catalog website that showcases Movies, Music, and Math through an old-school DVD menu experience — complete with themed pages, flip cards, videos, and even a custom remote control cursor for full nostalgic vibes!

## 💡 Features

- **Three themed rooms:** Movies, Music, and Math — each with interactive flip cards displaying curated content.
- **Custom cursor:** A remote control icon that stays active across the site, even while hovering and clicking.
- **Random M Button:** Instantly takes the user to a random page (Movie, Music, or Math) — like a surprise shuffle!
- **DVD-style layout:** Background looping videos and menu navigation mimic the classic DVD experience.
- **Navigation:** Each room contains an option to go back to the main menu or jump to other sections, DVD-style.
